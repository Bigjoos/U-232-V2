    <li>The allowed formats are .gif, .jpg and .png.</li>
    <li>Be considerate. Resize your images to a width of 150 px and a size of no more than 150 KB.
    (Browsers will rescale them anyway: smaller images will be expanded and will not look good;
    larger images will just waste bandwidth and CPU cycles.) For now this is just a guideline but
    it will be automatically enforced in the near future.</li>
    <li>Do not use potentially offensive material involving porn, religious material, animal / human
    cruelty or ideologically charged images. Mods have wide discretion on what is acceptable.
    If in doubt PM one.</li>

      <li>The stuff must not be older than seven (7) days.</li>
      <li>All files must be in original format (usually 14.3 MB RARs).</li>
      <li>Pre-release stuff should be labeled with an *ALPHA* or *BETA* tag.</li>
      <li>Make sure not to include any serial numbers, CD keys or similar in the description (you do <b>not</b> need to edit the NFO!).</li>
      <li>Make sure your torrents are well-seeded for at least 24 hours.</li>
      <li>Do not include the release date in the torrent name.</li>
      <li>Stay active! You risk being demoted if you have no active torrents.</li>
